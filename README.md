# My Homepage!

<p>This is a webpage I developed in HTML5 and CSS -- primarily because it had been a while since I'd done any web development, but also because I didn't have a website of my own. The site contains some basic information about myself, as well as some important links: a resume download button, my Github/LinkedIn, and an email form hosted on *formkeep.com*. </p>

**NOTE**: Darkreader extension may break elements of the site. Refreshing or turning the extension off fixes most of it. <br>
**NOTE**: On mobile, the footer may be missing some socials' links.<br>
